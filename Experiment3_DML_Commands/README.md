# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**

product_id
product_name
category
cost_price
sell_price
reorder_lvl
quantity
supplier_id
```
```sql
update Products
set product_name='Premium Bread'
where product_id=5;
```

**Output:**

first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
hire_date
job_id
salary
commission_pct

```sql
update Employees 
set salary=salary+500 , email="updated"
where job_id='SA_REP' and commission_pct>0.15;

-----------------  ---------------
product_id         INT
product_name       VARCHAR(100)
category           VARCHAR(50)

sell_price         DECIMAL(10,2)
reorder_lvl        INT
quantity           INT
supplier_id        INT
```
```sql
update PRODUCTS 
set sell_price= ROUND(sell_price*1.10)
where supplier_id=6;
